`stats-notes`
-----------

Notes for teaching statistics. These notes were made to accompany a social science statistics class. They emphasize important ideas and tries to connect them with verbal explanation, code, and worked examples. However, they are not meant to be comprehensive, and they may contain my own errors, which I will fix as I find them. I rely on multiple sources for explanation and examples.  

My thanks to the students of API-201Z (2017) for their feedback and Matt Blackwell for inspiration. To make these documents I used the templates from https://github.com/kjhealy/latex-custom-kjh
